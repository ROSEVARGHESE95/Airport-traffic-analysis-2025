# Airport-traffic-analysis-2025
In this project, I analyzed flight traffic data for the year 2025 to understand patterns and trends at various airports. Using machine learning, I built a model to predict future flight volumes, which can support decision-making in airport operations and planning. • Source: Airport traffic data for 2025 https://www.eurocontrol.int/performance/data/download/csv/airport_traffic_2025.csv

The dataset includes daily flight information such as departures, arrivals, total flights, and airport identifiers.

Benefits of using Machine Learning:
---------------------------------
Improved Accuracy: ML models can often outperform traditional methods in predicting traffic patterns and delays.

Efficiency: ML can help optimize airport operations, reduce delays, and improve resource allocation.

Enhanced Safety: Early detection of potential conflicts and improved decision-making can contribute to safer air traffic management.

Data-Driven Insights: ML provides data-driven insights into complex air traffic patterns, enabling more informed decision-making.

Preprocessing is essential for any machine learning model. I cleaned the data by removing duplicates and missing values. I also converted text into numerical format using label encoding to make it suitable for modeling.

• Removed duplicates

• Handled missing values

• Converted date columns

• Used Label Encoding for airport names and state names

Real world applications/Use cases of prediction:
------------------------------------------------
Traditional forecasting methods use simple rules or historical averages, which can miss complex patterns. Machine Learning can analyze large datasets, detect hidden trends, and make accurate predictions. It adapts to changing data, making it ideal for dynamic industries like aviation. Airports and aviation authorities can use this prediction to allocate resources, plan infrastructure, and manage air traffic efficiently.

• Staff & resource planning

• Air traffic control

• Budget forecasting

• Emergency planning

• Airport infrastructure development

Airports and airlines can use the model to predict daily or weekly flight traffic and plan resources accordingly.

Future use:

• Schedule runways, staff shifts, and ground services

• Predict busiest days or seasons

• Reduce delays and congestion

Real-Time Decision Support System  model can be integrated into an airport’s dashboard to:

• Continuously predict today’s or tomorrow’s flight traffic

• Trigger alerts if traffic exceeds capacity

• Help managers make decisions on-the-fly

Government and airport authorities can use it to:

• Forecast yearly growth

• Decide on new terminals, runways, or equipment

• Invest based on data-driven traffic predictions

Airports can use predicted traffic numbers to:

• Estimate revenue (more flights = more income)

• Plan marketing or airline partnerships

• Justify funding or expansions

Environmental& Regulatory Planning With traffic predictions:

• Authorities can control air pollution or noise levels

• Apply caps or curfews to maintain compliance

• Plan for greener infrastructure

Disaster & Emergency Planning During events like

• Bad weather

• Pandemics

• Strikes

→ This model can predict drops or spikes in flight traffic, helping management activate emergency protocols in advance.

Future Upgrades

This model can be improved by adding:

• Live weather data

• Flight delay information

• Passenger load data

It could evolve into a complete smart aviation forecasting system.
